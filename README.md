# Project-RedTeam

THIS REPOSITORY is for my own personal projects regarding networking, subnetting, phishing, cracking, decoding and many other cybersecurity related projects that help me understand my computer and terminal as well as the field better. 
The reason why I chose cybersecurity is because (aside from my interest) that it takes a lot of other programming languages and computer science disciplines and combines into one unified project.

Future projects

1. Python sockets
2. Bash
3. HTML
4. TCP and UDP messaging
5. SQL injections
